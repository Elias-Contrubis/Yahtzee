I worked solo on this assignment and I did not consult with any CMPU-101 students on this Yahtzee assignment.

How to play:

To start a new game, you must define a variable and set its value to the new game function.  This will look like: (define g (new-game)).  I used the variable g, short for game, for simplicity reasons because you will need to refer to your variable throughout the game.  Think of the variable as holding all the data for your Yahtzee game, so whenever you want to make a move in your game, you must refer to the variable.  After you have defined a variable for your game, there are only two function that you need to play, roll and score.

The syntax for the roll function is as follows, (roll g #(1 1 1 1 1)).  Roll is the name of the function, g is the variable discussed above and the following series of ones are how you roll your dice, we’ll refer to these ones as the dice vector.  The dice vector has five slots, one for each die, and can be filled with either a 1 or a 0.  A one denotes that you wish to roll that die and a zero denotes that you wish to keep that die as is.  It is important to keep in mind that on your first roll you must roll all 1’s otherwise the dice in the same slot as the zero will not receive an initial value.  After you call the roll function, the game will output the data necessary for playing Yahtzee.

The syntax for the score function is, (score g *slot*).  In terms of syntax the only difference between this function and the last is the *slot*.  You will not actually be typing *slot*, this is just a placeholder for the categories you wish to score your dice in.  The categories in order are, *ones*, *twos*, *threes*, *fours*, *fives*, *sixes*, *3-of-a-kind*, *4-of-a-kind*, *full-house*, *small-straight*, *large-straight*, *yahtzee*, and *chance*.  Instead of typing *slots* you will fill this section with one of the categories above based on which dice you rolled.  Though you get three rolls per turn, you do not have to use them all and are allowed to score at any time.  Like the roll function, after calling score, the game will output the necessary data to continue. 

After you begin playing you may notice that the *ones* slot is actually the second slot in the score board.  The first slot is the subtotal and shows your score as you precede throughout the game.  You might have also noticed two “-”, the first is the bonus category and the second is the total category.  Finally, you may also notice that in the game’s outputs there is something called “Carl’s Score.”  Carl is your imaginary opponent and his score is randomly computed from a range of reasonable Yahtzee scores.  Your goal is to beat Carl’s score, good luck.
